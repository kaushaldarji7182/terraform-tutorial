	-------------------
Infrastructure as Code (IaC) 
	widespread terminology among DevOps professionals. 
	Process of managing and provisioning the complete IT infrastructure 
	(comprises both physical and virtual machines) 
		using machine-readable definition files. 
	Automate environment provisioning process.
	Ease maintenance of the environment.
	Manage the source code of it in SCM.


Challenges with Infrastructure as Code :
	Need to learn to code
	Don’t know the change impact.
	Need to revert the change
	Can’t track changes
	Can’t automate a resource
	Multiple environments for infrastructure
	Terraform has been created to solve these challenges.

What is Terraform?
	Open-source infrastructure as Code 
	Developed by HashiCorp. 
	Used to define and provision the complete infrastructure 
	Declarative language.

	Infrastructure provisioning tool 
	Cloud infrastructure setup as codes. 
	Similar to tools like CloudFormation
		However provider independent.
	
	
Adv. of Terraform
	Does orchestration, not just configuration management
	Supports multiple providers such as AWS, Azure, GCP, DigitalOcean and many more
	Provide immutable infrastructure where configuration changes smoothly
	Uses easy to understand language, HCL (HashiCorp configuration language)
	Easily portable to any other provider
	Supports Client only architecture, so no need for additional configuration management on a server
	
	
	
Terraform Lifecycle
-------------------
	Terraform lifecycle consists of – 
		#validate: validates the syntax
		init, 
		plan, 
		apply
		destroy.

	
	Terraform init 
		initializes the working directory which consists of all the configuration files
	Terraform plan 
		creates an execution plan to reach a desired state of the infrastructure. Changes in the configuration files are done in order to achieve the desired state.
		This is optional
	Terraform apply 
		Makes the changes in the infrastructure as defined in the plan, and the infrastructure comes to the desired state.
	Terraform destroy 
		delete all the old infrastructure resources, which are marked tainted after the apply phase.
	
	
How Terraform Works?
---------------------
Terraform has two main components that make up its architecture:
	Terraform Core
	Providers	
	
	
	
Terraform Core
---------------
Terraform core 
	uses two input sources to do its job.
	first input source 
		Terraform configuration 
		user configures. 
		define what needs to be created or provisioned. 
	second input source 
		state where terraform keeps the current state.

	It is a utility which can calculate the delta between the current state and the desired state - make/apply these changes on the infrastructure.
	
	terraform core 
		takes the input
		figures out the plan of what needs to be done. 
		Compares current 
			state and configuration 
		with 
			desired state and configuration 
		
		Figures out plan to get to that desired state. 
		i.e. what needs to be 
			created
			updated
			deleted 
				to provision the infrastructure.

	CRUD: create, read, update and delete
	
Providers
---------
Second component of the architecture 
could be cloud providers like 
	AWS, 
	Azure, 
	GCP
	other infrastructure as a service platform. 
	It is also a provider for more high-level components like Kubernetes or other platform-as-a-service tools, even some software as a self-service tool.

Supports
	For example – 
		create an AWS infrastructure
		deploy Kubernetes on top of it 
		create services/components inside that Kubernetes cluster.

Terraform has 
	over a hundred providers 
	different technologies
	each provider then gives terraform user access to its resources. 
	For e.g. AWS provider
		gives access to hundreds of AWS resources 
			like EC2 instances
			AWS users, etc. 
		With Kubernetes provider
			access to commodities resources like services and deployments and namespaces, etc.

HCL
---
Low-level syntax of Terraform language 
	defined in HCL (HashiCorp configuration language)
	also used by configuration languages in other applications
		particular other HashiCorp products. 
	
	Full definition of HCL syntax can be seen in https://github.com/hashicorp/hcl/blob/hcl2/hclsyntax/spec.md
	
	
	
	
	Arguments
	---------
An argument assigns a value to a particular name:
	image_id = "abc123"

Syntax is like 	
	argument name =  argument's value.
	
	Terraform uses the word "attribute" instead of "argument".
	 
	Blocks
	------
	A block is a container for other content:

	} 

	Syntax 
	<block type> <parameters> {
		key1 = value1
		key2 = value2
	}

	Defined in curly braces.
	Has key value pair
	Defines 
		an infrastructure platform
		a set of resources with in that we want to create/manage
		
	
	e.g. we want to create a file
	mkdir temp
	cd temp
	
-------------------------------------
vi local.tf

resource "local_file" "vilas"{
	filename = "/root/vilas.txt"
	content = "My name is Vilas"
}
-------------------------------------	
This is a standard terraform block because the look and curly braces.
type of block : resource
	defined by terraform
local_file: resource type
	fixed value
	depends on the provider
	provides two information 
		seperated by "_"
		first: provider 
		second: type of resource
"vilas": resource name.
	Logical name
	Can be named anything.
{Arguments}
	Specific to type of resource we are creating.
	Here specific to local_file.
	filename: absolute path to the location where we want to create file.
	content: content which should be in the file.
	arguments vary based on the resource type.
	We should follow the standard defined by the resource type.
	
-------------------------------------	

resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami = "abc123"

  network_interface {
	# ...
  }
}

type: resource
provider: aws
require: EC2 instance
example: name
ami: ami of the instance
network_interface: network interface for the instance
-------------------------------------	
Update local.tf

vi local.tf

resource "local_file" "vilas"{
	filename = "/root/vilas.txt"
	content = "My name is Vilas!!"
	file_permission = "0700"
}
-------------------------------------	
terraform apply 

terraform will delete and create a new file.


-------------------------------------	

terraform init
	executed from a directory with terraform configurations
	terraform downloads and installs plugins for provider used in the configuration.
	shows the version of the plugin installed
		more on plugins latter
		
	
	
Providers
	can be 
		cloud providers
			aws
			azure
			gcp ect.
		local providers
		ect.
	Distributed by HashiCorp
	Publicly available in the Terraform registry
		registry.terraform.io
	3 tiers of proviers
		1. Owned and maintained by HashiCorp
			e.g. 
			aws
			azure
			gcp .
			local providers
		2. Verified provider
			Owned and maintained by 3rd party provider company
				Company in partnership with HashiCorp
				
			e.g. 
				bigip provider from FI network
				heroku
				digitalocean
		3. Community providers
			Published and maintained by individual community providers of HashiCorp community.
				activedirectory
				ucloud
				netapp-gcp

Terraform uses a plugins based architecture
	to work with 100's of infrastructure platforms
	
Plugins
	Terraform init downloads and installs plugins
	Provider specific.
	Installed into a <directory>/.terraform/plugins
	<directory>
		directory where terraform configuration files are present.
		Generate terraform init is executed being here.
	plgin name : source address
		e.g. hashicorp/local
		can be seen while executing terraform init.
		indentifier to locate and download pluigns
		hashicorp: organizational namespace
		local: type - provider name
			can be 
				aws
				azure
				rm
		plugin name can have a host name 
		registy.terraform.io/hashicorp/local
		
		
		
Configuration Directory
-----------------------
	Directory can have any number of configuration files.
	Any file with .tf extension will participate in CRUD of the infrastructure components.
	One file may have any number of configuraiton blocks.
	Common naming convention: main.tf
	
	Common other files found
		main.tf - main configurationv
		variables.tf - variables delclaration
		outputs.tf - outputs from resources.
		providers.tf - define providers
		
		

Multiple Providers
------------------
	Terraform supports working with multiple providers
		e.g. random
			can produce
				random_id
				random_password
				random_int
				random_string
				ect.
