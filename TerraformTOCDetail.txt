	-------------------
Infrastructure as Code (IaC) 
	Process of managing and provisioning the complete IT infrastructure 
	(comprises both physical and virtual machines) 
		using machine-readable definition files. 
	Automate environment provisioning process.
	Ease maintenance of the environment.
	Manage the source code of it in SCM.


Challenges with Infrastructure as Code :
	Need to learn to code
	Don’t know the change impact.
	Need to revert the change
	Can’t track changes
	Can’t automate a resource
	Multiple environments for infrastructure
	Terraform has been created to solve these challenges.


Terraform introduction	
----------------------
What is Terraform?
	Open-source infrastructure as Code 
	Developed by HashiCorp. 
	Used to define and provision the complete infrastructure 
	Declarative language.

	Infrastructure provisioning tool 
	Cloud infrastructure setup as codes. 
	Similar to tools like CloudFormation
		However provider independent.
	
	
Adv. of Terraform
	Does orchestration, not just configuration management
	Supports multiple providers such as AWS, Azure, GCP, DigitalOcean and many more
	Provide immutable infrastructure where configuration changes smoothly
	Uses easy to understand language, HCL (HashiCorp configuration language)
	Easily portable to any other provider
	Supports Client only architecture, so no need for additional configuration management on a server

The Core Terraform Workflow
The core Terraform workflow has three steps:
    Write - Author infrastructure as code.
    Plan - Preview changes before applying.
    Apply - Provision reproducible infrastructure.

Vilas: Copied from my notes
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

https://www.terraform.io/language
Terraform Language
	main purpose 
		declare resources
			represent infrastructure objects. 
	
	All other language features 
		make the definition of resources more flexible and convenient.

A Terraform configuration 
	complete document in Terraform language 
	Tells Terraform 
		how to manage a given collection of infrastructure. 
	Can consist of multiple files and directories.

Syntax of the Terraform language 
	simple

resource "aws_vpc" "main" {
  cidr_block = var.base_cidr_block
}

<BLOCK TYPE> "<BLOCK LABEL>" "<BLOCK LABEL>" {
  # Block body
  <IDENTIFIER> = <EXPRESSION> # Argument
}
e.g. 
resource "azurerm_resource_group" "myrg" { # Resource BLOCK
  name = "myrg-1" # Argument
  location = "East US" # Argument 
}

Blocks 
------
	Most of Terraform's features 
		controlled by top-level blocks in a configuration file.
		
	containers for other content 
	represent configuration of an object
		e.g. resource. 
	have a block type
	
	can have 
		zero or more labels
	a body 
		contains (number of) arguments 
		nested blocks. 
	



Arguments 
---------
	assign a value to a name. 
	They appear within blocks.
	can be 
		required or 
		optional
	Meta-Arguments 
		change a resource type's behavior 
			e.g.: 
				count, 
				for_each


Expressions 
-----------
	represent a value
	either 
		literally or 
		by referencing and combining other values. 
	Appear as values for arguments, or within other expressions.
	format:
		resource_type.resource_name.attribute_name
	 
The Terraform language 
----------------------
	declarative
		Describing an intended goal 
		Not steps to reach that goal. 
	The ordering of 
		blocks and 
		files 
			not significant; 
			
	Considers 
		implicit and 
		explicit relationships 
			between resources when determining an order of operations.

Files and Directories
---------------------
	Files containing Terraform 
		called configuration files.

	Configuration (Module) Directory
	-----------------------
		Directory 
			can have any number of configuration files.
		Any file with .tf extension 
			will participate in CRUD of the infrastructure components.
		One file 
			any number of configuraiton blocks.
		
		Common other files found
			main.tf - main configuration
			variables.tf - variables delclaration
			outputs.tf - outputs from resources.
			providers.tf - define providers
			
				can be .tf.json also - but commonly used.
		
	File Extension
	--------------
		Code in Terraform language 
			Stored in simple text files 
			.tf file extension. 
			or JSON-based variant - .tf.json file extension.

	Text Encoding
	-------------
		Configuration files must always use UTF-8 encoding, and by convention usually use Unix-style line endings (LF) rather than Windows-style line endings (CRLF), though both are accepted.

	Directories and Modules
	-----------------------
		
		A module 
			collection of .tf and/or .tf.json files 
			kept together in a directory.
		
		Similar to function definitions in traditional languages
		
		A Terraform module 
			consists of the top-level configuration files in a directory; 
			nested directories 
				treated as completely separate modules
				not automatically included in the configuration.

		Terraform evaluates 
			all configuration files in a module
			treat the entire module as a single document. 
		Separating blocks into different files 
			purely for the convenience 
			no effect on the module's behavior.

	A Terraform module 
		can use module calls 
		explicitly include other modules into the configuration. 
		Child modules can come from 
			nested directories, or 
			anywhere else on disk or 
			external sources 
				e.g. Terraform Registry.

The Root Module
---------------
	Terraform 
		always runs in the context of a single root module. 
		A complete Terraform configuration 
			has a root module 
			tree of child modules 
			(modules called by the root module
			modules called by those modules, etc.).

	root module 
		working directory where Terraform command is invoked.

Terraform Setting and Provider Block
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Step-01: Terraform Settings Block Introduction
	------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Terraform Settings
	------------------
		A special terraform configuration block 
		Used to configure 
			of Terraform itself
			e.g. minimum Terraform version to apply your configuration.

		Terraform Block Syntax
		terraform {
		  # ...
		}
		
		Each terraform block 
			can contain a number of settings 
			only constant values permitted
			
		Options supported in terraform block .
			Configuring Terraform Cloud
				https://www.terraform.io/language/settings
			Configuring a Terraform Backend
				For Remote State Storage
				https://www.terraform.io/language/settings
			Specifying a Required Terraform Version
			Specifying Provider Requirements
			Experimental Language Features
				https://www.terraform.io/language/settings
			Passing Metadata to Providers
				https://www.terraform.io/language/settings
				provider_meta block 
					for each provider a module 
				if the provider defines a schema for it. 
					This allows the provider to receive module-specific information
					primarily intended for modules distributed 
					by the same vendor as the associated provider.
	
	------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Step-02: Understand required_version in Terraform Block
	------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		
		Hands-on: 
			Manage Terraform Versions 
			required_version setting 
				accepts a version constraint string
				If the running version of Terraform 
					doesn't match the constraints 
					Terraform give error 
					exit without taking any further actions.

		For child modules, 
			each module can specify its own version requirements. 
			The requirements of all modules in the tree must be satisfied.

		Use Terraform version constraints 
			in a collaborative environment to ensure that everyone 
			is using a specific Terraform version, 
			or using at least a minimum Terraform version 
			that has behavior expected by the configuration.

		different from provider version

terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      version = "~> 2.13.0"
    }
    random = {
      version = ">= 2.1.2"
    }
  }
  required_version = "~> 0.12.29"

}	


		required_version 
			applies only Terraform CLI version. 
		Terraform's resource types 
			implemented by provider plugins, 
			release cycles are independent 
				of Terraform CLI and 
				of each other. 
		Use required_providers block 
			to manage the expected versions for each provider you use.
		

	------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Step-03: Terraform Provider Introduction
	------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		The required_providers block 
			specify all of the providers 
				required by the current module
			map each local provider name 
				to 
					a source address and 
					a version constraint.
	For aws
		terraform {
		  required_providers {
			aws = {
			  version = ">= 2.7.0"
			  source = "hashicorp/aws"
			}
		  }
		}
		
	For azure	
		terraform {
		  required_providers {
			azurerm = {
			  source  = "hashicorp/azurerm"
			  version = "=3.0.0"
			}
		  }
		}

	For multiple providers
		terraform {
		  required_providers {
			aws = {
			  version = "~> 2.13.0"
			}
			random = {
			  version = ">= 2.1.2"
			  #source is not mandatory
			}
		  }

		  required_version = "~> 0.12.29"
		}	

		Reference: steps/1/
		terraform init
		change version=">=3.0.0" 
						"=3.0.0"
		terraform init
	------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Step-04: Understand required_providers in Terraform Block and Provider Block
	------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Provider Requirements

	Terraform relies on plugins called "providers" 
		to interact with remote systems. 
		Terraform configurations must declare 
			which providers they require
		Terraform will install and use them. 

N.B:
	Values in 
		[] 
			called list
		{}
			caleld Map


	Note: 
		Supported from Terraform 0.13 and later; 
		A provider requirement consists of 
			local name (mycloud below)
			a source location, and 
			a version constraint:

terraform {
  required_providers {
    mycloud = {
      source  = "mycorp/mycloud"
      version = "~> 1.0"
    }
  }
}

	key: mycloud
		provider's local name 
		unique identifier 
			unique per-module
			module-specific
		value is an object 
			source - 
				the global source address 
				e.g. hashicorp/aws.
			version - 
				a version constraint 
		can choose any local name 
		has a preferred local name (e.g. aws)
		uses as a prefix for all of its resource types.
		hashicorp/aws - aws, like aws_instance or aws_security_group.)

		If possible
			use a provider's preferred local name. 
			make configurations easier to understand, 
				omit the provider meta-argument 
					from most of your resources. 
			(If provider is NOT configured, 
				first word of the resource type 
					as a local provider name.)


	Note: The name = { source, version } syntax
		added in Terraform v0.13. 
		
	Outside of the required_providers block, 
		Terraform configurations refer to providers by their local names.

terraform {
  required_providers {
    mycloud = {
      source  = "mycorp/mycloud"
      version = "~> 1.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "mycloud" {
  # ...
}

----------------------
lab/2

terraform {
  required_providers {
    azurerm = {
      source  = "hashicorp/azurerm"
      version = "=3.0.0"
    }
  }
}

# Configure the Microsoft Azure Provider
provider "azurerm" {
  features {}
}

# Create a resource group
resource "azurerm_resource_group" "example" {
  name     = "example-resources"
  location = "West Europe"
}
----------------------

Source Addresses
----------------

A provider's source address 
	global identifier. 
	primary location to download.
	three parts 
		delimited by slashes (/), as follows:
		[<HOSTNAME>/]<NAMESPACE>/<TYPE>

    Hostname (optional): 
		hostname of the Terraform registry 
			distributes the provider. 
		default:
			registry.terraform.io
			public Terraform Registry.
    Namespace (mandatory): 
		organizational namespace 
			in registry
		In 
			public Terraform Registry and 
			Terraform Cloud's private registry, 
				organization that publishes the provider. 
    Type(mandatory): 
		A short name for 
			platform provider manages. 
		Must be unique in 
			namespace on a particular registry host.
		provider's preferred local name. 
		(Exceptions; 
			hashicorp/google-beta 
				alternate to hashicorp/google
				preferred local name is google. 
		)

	official HTTP provider 
		part of hashicorp namespace 
		on registry.terraform.io
		source address 
			registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/http or, 
			commonly: hashicorp/http.

	The source address 
		with all three components 
			called the provider's fully-qualified address. 
	can be seen in various outputs
		e.g. error messages
		in most cases a simplified display version is used. 
	
	Display version 
		omits the source host 
		for public registry, 
		so "hashicorp/random" 
			instead of "registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/random".

	Note: 
		If you omit the source argument for provider, 
		default registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/<LOCAL NAME>. 
		recommend: using explicit source addresses for all providers.

Version Constraints
	Each provider plugin 
		has set of versions
		functionality of the provider 
			can evolve over time. 
		Each provider 
			define version constraint 
			given in the version argument 
		so Terraform can select a single version per provider 
		that all modules are compatible with.

	The version argument is optional; 
		if omitted, 
		accept any version of the provider as compatible. 
		recommend 
			specify a version constraint.

	To ensure Terraform always installs the same provider versions 
		for a given configuration, 
		use Terraform CLI 
			to create a dependency lock file and 
			commit it to version control 
	If a lock file is present, 
		Terraform Cloud, 
		CLI, and 
		Enterprise 
			will all obey it when installing providers.

lab: 
			Try the Lock and Upgrade Provider Versions.

Best Practices for Provider Versions
	declare the minimum provider version 
		use >= version constraint syntax:

terraform {
  required_providers {
    mycloud = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = ">= 1.0"
    }
  }
}

root module of a configuration — 
	specify the maximum provider version 
	avoid accidental upgrades 
	to incompatible new versions. 
	~> operator  
	The following example 

terraform {
  required_providers {
    mycloud = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "~> 1.0.4"
    }
  }
}
Recommendation:
Child modules can define minimum version 
	root module manage the maximum version.



Built-in Providers
------------------
Most Terraform providers 
	distributed as plugins

one built in provider  
	provides the terraform_remote_state data source.
don't need to declare 
	available to define in required_providers block 
For consistency 
	has special provider source address, 
	terraform.io/builtin/terraform. 
	sometimes appear in Terraform's error messages 

Deprecated provider
-------------------
	Another provider with source address 
		hashicorp/terraform
		older version of the now-built-in provider 
		not compatible with Terraform v0.11 or later 
		should never be declared in a required_providers block.


In-house Providers
------------------
We can 
	develop and distribute 
	Terraform providers. 



run an in-house private registry
	implement provider registry protocol.
Providers 
	mandatory: 
		source address 
		hostname of a registry
		hostname does not need to provide an actual registry service. 
		in-house providers  
			use an arbitrary hostname 
			
terraform {
  required_providers {
    mycloud = {
      source  = "terraform.example.com/examplecorp/ourcloud"
      version = ">= 1.0"
    }
  }
}

address: terraform.example.com/examplecorp/ourcloud/1.0.0

Directory structure
In 1.0.0 directory
	an additional directory 
		platform, 
		e.g. linux_amd64 - AMD64/x64 processor, and 
	

v0.12-Compatible Provider Requirements
--------------------------------------

    Provider type names 
		always be written in lowercase. 
		Terraform v0.13 
			provider source address: 
				case-insensitive
	

This tutorial is covered based on Terraform v0.13 and above.	
	------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
	Step-05: Terraform Apply and Destroy Commands Auto Approve Option
	------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	https://www.terraform.io/cli/commands/apply
	Command: apply
	
	terraform apply
	terraform apply -auto-approve
	terraform destroy
	To delete a particular resource
	terraform destroy -target RESOURCE_TYPE.NAME
	terraform destroy -auto-approve

	The terraform apply 
		execute the actions proposed in a Terraform plan.



	run terraform apply 
		without plan file
		creates a new execution plan = terraform plan
		prompts to approve 
		takes the indicated actions. 
		
		
		
Warning: If you use -auto-approve, 
	recommend 
		no one can change outside Terraform workflow. 
		
Saved Plan Mode
---------------
	pass a saved plan file to terraform apply, 
	no confirmation required. 
	use in automation.


	step2/
	terraform plan -out tfplan
	terraform show tfplan #inspect saved plan
	terraform apply "tfplan"

When using a saved plan
	additional planning modes not supported 
	
	
Plan Options
------------

    Planning Modes: 
		include 
			terraform plan -destroy
				creates a plan to destroy all remote objects
			terraform plan -refresh-only
				creates a plan to update 
					Terraform state 
					root module output values.
    Planning Options: 
		specify which 
			resource instances Terraform should replace
		setting Terraform input variables, etc.

Apply Options
-------------
    -auto-approve 
		Skips interactive approval 
		option is ignored 
			when you pass a previously-saved plan file, 
    -compact-warnings
    -input=false 
		- Disables all of Terraform's interactive prompts. 
		- prevents prompting for interactive approval of a plan
    -json - 
		machine readable JSON UI output. 
		implies -input=false.
    -lock=false - 
		Don't hold a state lock during the operation. 
			dangerous 
			others might concurrently run commands.
    -lock-timeout=DURATION - 
		Unless locking is disabled with -lock=false, 
		Terraform should retry acquiring a lock 
			return an error. 
		-lock-timeout="3s" for three seconds.
    -no-color - Disables terminal formatting sequences in the output
    -parallelism=n - 
		Limit the number of concurrent operation as Terraform walks the graph. 
		Defaults to 10.

    All planning modes and planning options for terraform plan - Customize how Terraform will create the plan. Only available when you run terraform apply without a saved plan file.


For configurations using the local backend only, terraform apply also accepts the legacy options -state, -state-out, and -backup.



Command: destroy
	destroy all remote objects 
		managed by a particular Terraform configuration.


Usage
Usage: terraform destroy [options]

This command is just a convenience alias for the following command:
terraform apply -destroy

So this command accepts 
	most of the options that terraform apply 
	does not accept a plan file argument 
	
	
terraform plan -destroy
terraform destroy -auto-approve 

Note: The -destroy option to terraform apply 
	exists only in Terraform v0.15.2 and later. 
		use terraform destroy .


	-auto-approve is not mentioned in documentation for destroy. 
	But will work.

Apply configuration
-------------------
Steps terraform takes.
	1. Lock your project's state
			so other instances of Terraform 
				will not attempt to 
				modify state or 
					apply changes to your resources. 
	2. If Terraform detects an existing lock file 
		(.terraform.tfstate.lock.info), 
		report an error and exit.
	3. Execute steps according to the plan.
		Terraform 
			executes in parallel 
			when possible, 
		and sequentially 
			when one resource 
				depends on another.
	4. Update your project's state file 
		with a snapshot of the current state 
	5. Unlock the state file.
	6. Print out 
		(a) report of the changes it made
		(b) any output values defined 
		
Errors during apply
-------------------
If apply has errors
	Logs the error and reports it to the console.
	Updates the state file with any changes to your resources.
	Unlocks the state file.
	Exits.
Terraform does not support 
	rolling back a partially-completed apply. 
	infrastructure may be in an invalid state 
		after a Terraform apply step errors out. 
	So resolve error, 
		apply configuration again 
			to update your infrastructure to the desired state.



Common reasons for apply:
--------------------------------------
	A change to a resource outside of Terraform's control.
		while execution is going on someone deletes RG.
	Networking or other transient errors.
	An expected error from the upstream API, 
		e.g. duplicate resource name or reaching a resource limit.
	An unexpected error from the upstream API
		e.g. internal server error.
	A bug in 
		Terraform provider code
		Terraform itself.
		our configuration

Terraform Multiple Provider
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
	Step-01: Terraform Multiple Providers Introduction
	------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Provider Configuration
	----------------------
	Providers 
		allow Terraform to interact with 
			cloud providers
			SaaS providers, and 
			other APIs.

	Some providers require  
		configure 
			endpoint URLs, 
			cloud regions
			other settings 
				before Terraform can use them. 
	
	
	Provider Configuration
	----------------------
	Provider configurations 
		belong in the root module of a Terraform configuration. 
	A provider configuration 
		use a provider block:

provider "google" {
  project = "acme-app"
  region  = "us-central1"
}

	Provider block is optional
	name ("google") 
		local name of the provider to configure. 
		provider should be included in 
			required_providers block.
	block (between { and }) contains 
		configuration arguments for the provider. 
		most options
			defined by the provider 
			project and region are specific to the google provider.
		values 
			supported values.
			reference input variables
			not attributes exported by resources 
		provider's documentation 
			should list which configuration arguments it expects. 
	Some values
		use shell environment variables 
			(e.g. VM instance profiles) 
		recommend 
			use for credentials 
				out of your version-controlled Terraform code.
	two "meta-arguments" 
		defined by Terraform itself 
		available for all provider blocks:
			alias:
				use same provider with different configurations for different resources
			version: 
				not recommended 
					(use provider requirements instead)
	
alias: Multiple Provider Configurations
---------------------------------------
	Optionally define 
		multiple configurations 
		for the same provider
	select which one to use on 
		per-resource 
	or 
		per-module basis. 
	Why?
		support multiple regions 
		targeting multiple Docker hosts
		multiple Consul hosts, etc.
	To create multiple configurations for a provider, 
		include multiple 
			provider blocks 
			with the same provider name. 
	For each additional non-default configuration, 
		use "alias" meta-argument 
		to provide an extra name segment. 

	For example:
# The default provider configuration; resources that begin with `aws_` will use
# it as the default, and it can be referenced as `aws`.
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}

# Additional provider configuration for west coast region; resources can
# reference this as `aws.west`.
provider "aws" {
  alias  = "west"	#This is critical
  region = "us-west-2"
}

	To declare a configuration alias within a module
		add "configuration_aliases" argument 
		as below:

terraform {
  required_providers {
    mycloud = {
      source  = "mycorp/mycloud"
      version = "~> 1.0"
      configuration_aliases = [ mycloud.alternate ]
    }
  }
}

	Default Provider Configurations
	-------------------------------
		default: 
			provider block without alias 
	
	Referring to Alternate Provider Configurations
	----------------------------------------------
	Refer as 
		<PROVIDER NAME>.<ALIAS>. 
	e.g.		
		aws.west 
			refer to us-west-2 region.

			not strings

	Selecting Alternate Provider Configurations
	---------------------------------------------
	To use 
		alternate provider configuration for 
			a resource or 
			data source
		set its 
			provider meta-argument to a 
				<PROVIDER NAME>.<ALIAS> reference:

resource "aws_instance" "foo" {
  provider = aws.west

  # ...
}

N.B: 
Child Modules
	A Terraform module 
		root module
			can call other modules 
				called child modules
				to include their resources 
					into the configuration. 
To select alternate provider configurations for a child module
	use its providers meta-argument:

module "aws_vpc" {
  source = "./another_aws_vpc"
  providers = {
    aws = aws.west
  }
}


	Most cases, 
		only root modules 
			should define provider configurations
		child modules 
			obtain their provider configurations from their parents.
	version (Deprecated)
	--------------------
	The version argument in provider configurations is deprecated. 
	In Terraform 0.13 and later
	always declare provider version constraints in the required_providers block.

	------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
https://github.com/stacksimplify/hashicorp-certified-terraform-associate-on-azure/tree/main/08-Providers-Dependency-Lock-File


Terraform configuration 
	has two external dependency
	(outside it's code base)
		Providers
		Modules
	
	version constraints
		define compatible dependency
	Dependency lock file:
		after selecting specific version 
		terraform remembers decision based on 
			dependency lock file
		so same decision can be made again
		Location: 
			current directory
	N.B: Currently supports only provider dependencies
		For module use exact version. Don't use >=
		
	Advantages of lock file
	-----------------------
		Without lock file
			download the latest version among supported
				defined in required_providers block
		With lock file
			always install same provider version
			dev./stage/production parity.

	Step-04: Terraform Resource Behavior Introduction
	------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	https://www.terraform.io/language/resources
	https://www.terraform.io/language/resources/behavior
	
	
	Resources 
		most important element 
		resource block 
			describes one or more infrastructure objects
			e.g. 
				virtual networks, 
				compute instances, 
				or higher-level components 
					such as DNS records.

		Meta-Arguments 
			special arguments that can be used with every resource type
			e.g. 
				depends_on, 
				count, 
				for_each, 
				provider, and 
				lifecycle.

		Provisioners 
			configure post-creation actions 
			non-declarative 
			potentially unpredictable
			recommendation
				treat them as a last resort.


Resource Behavior
-----------------
resource block 
	declares 
		infrastructure object with the given settings. 
	Applying a Terraform configuration 
		process of 
			creating, 
			updating, and 
			destroying 
				real infrastructure objects 
		attempt to match actual state == desired state.

How Terraform Applies a Configuration
-------------------------------------
	For new infrastructure object represented by a resource block
		new object created
		identifier of object saved in Terraform's state
		allows to update  
			in response to future changes. 
	For existing resource blocks 
		object present in the state
		Terraform compares 
			actual infrastructure with configuration 
			updates the object to match the configuration.

So apply will:
	Create an infrastructure
		which is not present
	Destroy resources removed in configuration.
	Update in-place resources whose arguments have changed.
		refer command argument help.
	Destroy and re-create resources 
		if arguments have changed 
			cannot be updated in-place.

Accessing Resource Attributes
-----------------------------
Use 
	<RESOURCE TYPE>.<NAME>.<ATTRIBUTE> 
		to reference 
	Mostly
		read-only attributes 
		e.g. resource's unique random ID.

	Most providers also support data sources
		e.g. ami

Resource Dependencies
---------------------
Terraform can change
	unrelated resources in parallel.
But for dependent resources
	follow sequential execution

Most resource dependencies
	handled automatically. 

Terraform 
	analyses expressions in resource block 
		find references to other objects
		creates order for 
			creating, 
			updating, or 
			destroying resources. 
	
Some dependencies 
	cannot be recognized implicitly 
	For e.g., 
		create access control policies 
		take actions based on those policies 
			hidden dependency between 
				access policy and
				resource 
	Use meta-argument
		depends_on 
	or 
		replace_triggered_by 
			forces Terraform to replace 
				parent resource 
					when referenced resource or resource attribute changes

Local-only Resources
--------------------
specialized resource types 
	within Terraform itself
	e.g. 
		for generating private keys
		self-signed TLS certificates
		generate random ids. 
		
	lab already covered.	
		
behavior of local-only resources 
	same as other resources
		But: result data exists only within the Terraform state. 
	"Destroying" local resource 
		remove it from state, 
		discarding its data.
	
	More on resources below
	https://www.terraform.io/language/resources/syntax

	Step-05: Resource Behavior: Create Resource Demo
	------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
	Step-06: Understand Terraform State in detail
	------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	https://www.terraform.io/language/state
	
	State
	-----
	primary object for terraform to function
	database containing the resources information 
	When Terraform creates a remote object 
		record the identity of that remote object 
		against a resource instance
		potentially 
			update or delete that object 
			in response to future configuration changes.
	Terraform state file created when we first run the terraform apply
	Terraform state file is created locally in working directory.
	confiure the backend block 
		in terraform block 
			store state file remotely. 
	Storing remotely is recommended option 
		
	
		Terraform store state about 
			managed infrastructure and 
			configuration. 
		used to 
			map real world resources 
				to configuration
			create binding between 
				remote real world resources
				with config.
		why?	
			keep track of metadata
				for e.g. if you delete a config?
			improve performance.
			
		by default stored in 
			"terraform.tfstate"
				locally
			can store remotely
				for team 
				
		Prior to any operation
			Terraform refresh 
				update the state 
					with the real infrastructure.

https://www.terraform.io/language/state/purpose

Purpose of Terraform State
--------------------------
	to 
		Map to the Real World
		manage Metadata
		for Syncing
	
Mapping to the Real World
-------------------------
	Terraform requires some database 
		to map Terraform config 
			to the real world. 
	for e.g.
		to delete the resource
	
	
	For some providers like AWS
		could have used AWS tags. 
			Early prototypes implementation used tags
	problems
		1: not all resources support tags
		2: not all cloud providers support tags.

	So Terraform uses states
	
	each remote object 
		bound to only one resource instance in the configuration. 
	

Metadata
---------
	Terraform must also track 
		metadata 
			like resource dependencies.
	While deleting resources, 
		terraform should find
			order of deleting
			e.g. vm before subnet.
		dependency can be complicated if multiple providers are present
	
Performance
-----------
	performance improvement
		optional feature of Terraform state 
	When running a terraform plan, 
		Terraform must 
			know the current state 
				to determine the changes.
	default behavior of Terraform: 
		for every plan and apply, 
		sync all resources in your state.
	Problem with refresh
		For each infra.
			Very slow
		Rate limiting can block
	Solution
		use 
			-refresh=false flag and 
				terraform plan -refresh=false or 
				terraform apply -refresh=false.
				Reference: https://www.terraform.io/cloud-docs/run/modes-and-options
			-target flag 
		cached state is treated as the record of truth.

Syncing
-------
	
	Remote state 
		working in team.
		can use remote locking 
			avoid multiple users 
				accidentally running Terraform at the same time
			
			

Inspection and Modification
---------------------------
	direct file editing of the state is discouraged. 
	terraform state command 
		basic modifications of the state using the CLI.

	Terraform expects a one-to-one mapping 
		Normally that is guaranteed by Terraform 

	If you add or remove bindings in the state by other means
		e.g. import externally-created objects with terraform import
	or	
		ask Terraform to "forget" an existing object 
			terraform state rm
			
		we have to ensure one-to-one relation maintained
			manually manage
			terraform import
			
Format
------
	State snapshots 
		stored in JSON format 
	
	terraform output command 
		has a -json option, for obtaining either the full set of root module output values or a specific named output value from the latest state snapshot.
	The terraform show command has a -json option for inspecting the latest state snapshot in full, and also for inspecting saved plan files which include a  of the prior state at the time the plan was made.
	A typical way to use these in situations where Terraform is running in automation is to run them immediately after a successful terraform apply to obtain a representation of the latest state snapshot, and then store that result as an artifact associated with the automated run so that other software can potentially consume it without needing to run Terraform itself.

	Step-07: Resource Behavior: Update-In-Place, Destroy-Recreate and Destroy Demo's
	------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Update-In-Place	
		In place update
From lab/9
	Add tags = {
		"Name" = vilasvnet
		"Environment" = "Dev"
	}
		
	terraform validate
	terraform plan
		Check update in-place
		
	Destroy-Recreate
		destroy and create resource
		
	Change 
		name of network_interface
	terraform validate
	terraform plan
	
	https://www.terraform.io/cli/state/taint
Forcing Re-creation of Resources
--------------------------------
During planning
	default 
		retrieves the latest state 
			of each existing object and 
		compares it 
			with the current configuration, 
		plan actions 
			only against objects 
		current state 
			does not match the configuration.

In some cases 
	remote object get 
		damaged or 
		degraded 
			Terraform cannot automatically detect. 
	For e.g., 
		if app in vm crashes 
	We can force a replace
		-replace=
	
lab/...
	Update name
	terraform apply fails
	terraform apply -replace=azurerm_network_interface.myvm1nic
	
$ terraform apply -replace=aws_instance.example
  # aws_instance.example will be replaced, as requested

The "tainted" status
--------------------
	Sometimes Terraform 
		can detect the damage
	for e.g.
		creation of a complex object 
			partially fails
		e.g. provisioner fails.

	Terraform marks an object in the state as "tainted". 
	Impact:
		next plan will force replace
			similar to -replace we manually specify.

	  # aws_instance.example is tainted, so must be replaced
	-/+ resource "aws_instance" "example" {
		  # ...
		}

Force Taint/Untaint
-------------------
If Terraform mark an object as tainted 
	but is working correctly 
	don't want to replace 
	we can override Terraform
		use terraform untaint command
	
We can force Terraform 
	mark an object as tainted 
	use 
		deprecated: terraform taint command
	 for
		-replace=

Modify 
-------------------
By default, a resource block configures one real infrastructure object. (Similarly, a module block includes a child module's contents into the configuration one time.) However, sometimes you want to manage several similar objects (like a fixed pool of compute instances) without writing a separate block for each one. Terraform has two ways to do this: count and for_each.

If a resource or module block includes a count argument whose value is a whole number, Terraform will create that many instances.

Basic Syntax
count is a meta-argument defined by the Terraform language. It can be used with modules and with every resource type.

The count meta-argument accepts a whole number, and creates that many instances of the resource or module. Each instance has a distinct infrastructure object associated with it, and each is separately created, updated, or destroyed when the configuration is applied.

resource "aws_instance" "server" {
  count = 4 # create four similar EC2 instances

  ami           = "ami-a1b2c3d4"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"

  tags = {
    Name = "Server ${count.index}"
  }
}

The count Object
In blocks where count is set, an additional count object is available in expressions, so you can modify the configuration of each instance. This object has one attribute:

count.index — The distinct index number (starting with 0) corresponding to this instance.
Using Expressions in count
The count meta-argument accepts numeric expressions. However, unlike most arguments, the count value must be known before Terraform performs any remote resource actions. This means count can't refer to any resource attributes that aren't known until after a configuration is applied (such as a unique ID generated by the remote API when an object is created).

Referring to Instances
When count is set, Terraform distinguishes between the block itself and the multiple resource or module instances associated with it. Instances are identified by an index number, starting with 0.

<TYPE>.<NAME> or module.<NAME> (for example, aws_instance.server) refers to the resource block.
<TYPE>.<NAME>[<INDEX>] or module.<NAME>[<INDEX>] (for example, aws_instance.server[0], aws_instance.server[1], etc.) refers to individual instances.
This is different from resources and modules without count or for_each, which can be referenced without an index or key.

Similarly, resources from child modules with multiple instances are prefixed with module.<NAME>[<KEY>] when displayed in plan output and elsewhere in the UI. For a module without count or for_each, the address will not contain the module index as the module's name suffices to reference the module.

Note: Within nested provisioner or connection blocks, the special self object refers to the current resource instance, not the resource block as a whole.

»When to Use for_each Instead of count
If your instances are almost identical, count is appropriate. If some of their arguments need distinct values that can't be directly derived from an integer, it's safer to use for_each.

Before for_each was available, it was common to derive count from the length of a list and use count.index to look up the original list value:

variable "subnet_ids" {
  type = list(string)
}

resource "aws_instance" "server" {
  # Create one instance for each subnet
  count = length(var.subnet_ids)

  ami           = "ami-a1b2c3d4"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  subnet_id     = var.subnet_ids[count.index]

  tags = {
    Name = "Server ${count.index}"
  }
}


Count was fragile
	resource instances identified by their index 
		instead of the string values 
	If an element was removed from the middle 
		subnet_id for every instance after 
			would change, 
		more remote object changes than intended. 
	Solution:
		Use for_each.

Meta argument lifecycle create_before_destroy , Prevent Destroy and Ignore_change
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


resource "azurerm_resource_group" "example" {
  # ...

  lifecycle {
    create_before_destroy = true
  }
}

Syntax and Arguments
--------------------
lifecycle block 
	contents are meta-arguments
	available for all resource blocks 
	
	arguments available "meta-argument"
		create_before_destroy, 
		prevent_destroy, 
		ignore_changes
		replace_triggered_by.

create_before_destroy (bool) - 
	For Terraform to change 
		a resource argument 
			that cannot be updated in-place 
			due to remote API limitations
		Terraform 
			destroy the existing object 
			then create a new replacement object.

create_before_destroy 
	change default behaviour
	new replacement object is created first
	prior object is destroyed after the replacement is created.

	an opt-in behavior 
		unique name 
			create before destroy can fail
		so opt in wisely.
		

prevent_destroy (bool) - 
	Terraform will 
		reject 
		throw an error 
			attempt to destroy the infrastructure object associated with the resource
	e.g. database resource created.
	Don't want to delete by mistake

ignore_changes (list of attribute names) - 
	By default, 
		Terraform detects configuration updates.
		Modifies the infrastructure

	if a resource can be modified by process outside Terraform
	for such valid updates Terraform should not modify.
	ignore_changes
		has not effect during 
			create and destroy operation
		has effect only during update

resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  # ...

  lifecycle {
    ignore_changes = [
      # Ignore changes to tags, e.g. because a management agent
      # updates these based on some ruleset managed elsewhere.
      tags,
    ]
  }
}

	ignore_changes can only ignore 
		attributes defined by the resource 
		cannot ignore 
			meta-arguments 
				including 
					lifecycle
					count

replace_triggered_by 
	(list of resource or attribute references) - 
	Added in Terraform 1.2. 
	Replaces the resource 
		when any of the referenced items change. 
		
		
		
		
References trigger replacement in the following conditions:

	If the reference is 
		multiple instances resource
			update or replace any instance 
				will trigger replacement.
		single resource instance
			update or replace that instance will trigger replacement.
		single attribute 
			change to the attribute value 
				will trigger replacement.
	
resource "aws_appautoscaling_target" "ecs_target" {
  # ...
  lifecycle {
    replace_triggered_by = [
      # Replace `aws_appautoscaling_target` each time this instance of
      # the `aws_ecs_service` is replaced.
      aws_ecs_service.svc.id
    ]
  }
}


Custom Condition Checks
	You can add precondition and postcondition blocks with a lifecycle block to specify assumptions and guarantees about how resources and data sources operate. The following examples creates a precondition that checks whether the AMI is properly configured.

resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  ami           = "ami-abc123"

  lifecycle {
    # The AMI ID must refer to an AMI that contains an operating system
    # for the `x86_64` architecture.
    precondition {
      condition     = data.aws_ami.example.architecture == "x86_64"
      error_message = "The selected AMI must be for the x86_64 architecture."
    }
  }
}
	Custom conditions can help capture assumptions, helping future maintainers understand the configuration design and intent. They also return useful information about errors earlier and in context, helping consumers more easily diagnose issues in their configurations.

Refer to Custom Conditions for more details.

Literal Values Only
	The lifecycle settings all affect how Terraform constructs and traverses the dependency graph. As a result, only literal values can be used because the processing happens too early for arbitrary expression evaluation.

Terraform Input Variable
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Step-01: Define Terraform Input Variable
	------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	Input variables let you customize aspects of Terraform modules without altering the module's own source code. This functionality allows you to share modules across different Terraform configurations, making your module composable and reusable.

When you declare variables in the root module of your configuration, you can set their values using CLI options and environment variables. When you declare them in child modules, the calling module should pass values in the module block.

	Terraform supports various ways to pass input variables
	Following are those ways
	1. Input variables - Basics
	2. Provide input variables when prompted 
		during 
			plan
			apply
	3. Override default variables using 
		-var cli argument
		environment variables (TF_var_aa)
	4. Provide input variables using 
		terraform.tfvars files
	5. Input variables using structural types
	6. Provide input variables using 
		somename.tfvars
			using -var-file cli 
	7. Provide input variables using somename.auto.tfvars file
	8. Implement complex type constructors like
		list 
		map 
			in input variables
	9. Implement custom validation rules in variables
	10. Protect sensitive input variables
	11. Input variables using structural type
			tuple
			set
			
	
		



variable "image_id" {
  type = string
}

variable "availability_zone_names" {
  type    = list(string)
  default = ["us-west-1a"]
}

variable "docker_ports" {
  type = list(object({
    internal = number
    external = number
    protocol = string
  }))
  default = [
    {
      internal = 8300
      external = 8300
      protocol = "tcp"
    }
  ]
}


The label after variable 
	name for the variable
	must be unique among all variables 
		in the same module. 
	used to assign a value.

The name of a variable can be any valid identifier 
	except the following: 
		source, 
		version, 
		providers, 
		count, 
		for_each, 
		lifecycle, 
		depends_on, 
		locals.

»Arguments
	optional arguments for variable declarations:

		default
			optional
				if not specified anywhere
					prompted
		type - 
			optional
				any value can be specified
			recommend specify
				appropriate error
			can be 
				string
				number
				bool
			or complex types such as collections:
				list(<TYPE>)
				set(<TYPE>)
				map(<TYPE>)
				object({<ATTR NAME> = <TYPE>, ... })
				tuple([<TYPE>, ...])
		description 
			get's printed
		validation - 
			usually in addition to type constraints.
		sensitive - 
			
		nullable - 




Custom Validation Rules
-----------------------
variable "image_id" {
  type        = string
  description = "The id of the machine image (AMI) to use for the server."

  validation {
    condition     = length(var.image_id) > 4 && substr(var.image_id, 0, 4) == "ami-"
    error_message = "The image_id value must be a valid AMI id, starting with \"ami-\"."
  }
}

Suppressing Values in CLI Output
----------------------------------
introduced in Terraform v0.14.0.

	sensitive 
		prevents Terraform from showing its value 

variable "user_information" {
  type = object({
    name    = string
    address = string
  })
  sensitive = true
}

Disallowing Null Input Values
-----------------------------
variable "example" {
  type     = string
  nullable = false
}


default value 
	nullable is true. 
	can pass null 
		will override default


»Using Input Variable Values
Within the module that declared a variable, its value can be accessed from within expressions as var.<NAME>, where <NAME> matches the label given in the declaration block:

Note: Input variables are created by a variable block, but you reference them as attributes on an object named var.

resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  ami           = var.image_id
}


The value assigned to a variable can only be accessed in expressions within the module where it was declared.

»Assigning Values to Root Module Variables
When variables are declared in the root module of your configuration, they can be set in a number of ways:

In a Terraform Cloud workspace.
Individually, with the -var command line option.
In variable definitions (.tfvars) files, either specified on the command line or automatically loaded.
As environment variables.
The following sections describe these options in more detail. This section does not apply to child modules, where values for input variables are instead assigned in the configuration of their parent module, as described in Modules.

»Variables on the Command Line
To specify individual variables on the command line, use the -var option when running the terraform plan and terraform apply commands:

terraform apply -var="image_id=ami-abc123"
terraform apply -var='image_id_list=["ami-abc123","ami-def456"]' -var="instance_type=t2.micro"
terraform apply -var='image_id_map={"us-east-1":"ami-abc123","us-east-2":"ami-def456"}'


The above examples show appropriate syntax for Unix-style shells, such as on Linux or macOS. For more information on shell quoting, including additional examples for Windows Command Prompt, see Input Variables on the Command Line.

You can use the -var option multiple times in a single command to set several different variables.

»Variable Definitions (.tfvars) Files
To set lots of variables, it is more convenient to specify their values in a variable definitions file (with a filename ending in either .tfvars or .tfvars.json) and then specify that file on the command line with -var-file:

terraform apply -var-file="testing.tfvars"

Note: This is how Terraform Cloud passes workspace variables to Terraform.

A variable definitions file uses the same basic syntax as Terraform language files, but consists only of variable name assignments:

image_id = "ami-abc123"
availability_zone_names = [
  "us-east-1a",
  "us-west-1c",
]

Terraform also automatically loads a number of variable definitions files if they are present:

Files named exactly terraform.tfvars or terraform.tfvars.json.
Any files with names ending in .auto.tfvars or .auto.tfvars.json.
Files whose names end with .json are parsed instead as JSON objects, with the root object properties corresponding to variable names:

{
  "image_id": "ami-abc123",
  "availability_zone_names": ["us-west-1a", "us-west-1c"]
}

»Environment Variables
As a fallback for the other ways of defining variables, Terraform searches the environment of its own process for environment variables named TF_VAR_ followed by the name of a declared variable.

This can be useful when running Terraform in automation, or when running a sequence of Terraform commands in succession with the same variables. For example, at a bash prompt on a Unix system:

$ export TF_VAR_image_id=ami-abc123
$ terraform plan
...

On operating systems where environment variable names are case-sensitive, Terraform matches the variable name exactly as given in configuration, and so the required environment variable name will usually have a mix of upper and lower case letters as in the above example.

»Complex-typed Values
When variable values are provided in a variable definitions file, you can use Terraform's usual syntax for literal expressions to assign complex-typed values, like lists and maps.

Some special rules apply to the -var command line option and to environment variables. For convenience, Terraform defaults to interpreting -var and environment variable values as literal strings, which need only shell quoting, and no special quoting for Terraform. For example, in a Unix-style shell:

$ export TF_VAR_image_id='ami-abc123'

However, if a root module variable uses a type constraint to require a complex value (list, set, map, object, or tuple), Terraform will instead attempt to parse its value using the same syntax used within variable definitions files, which requires careful attention to the string escaping rules in your shell:

$ export TF_VAR_availability_zone_names='["us-west-1b","us-west-1d"]'

For readability, and to avoid the need to worry about shell escaping, we recommend always setting complex variable values via variable definitions files. For more information on quoting and escaping for -var arguments, see Input Variables on the Command Line.

»Values for Undeclared Variables
If you have defined a variable value, but not its corresponding variable {} definition, you may get an error or warning depending on how you have provided that value.

If you provide values for undeclared variables defined as environment variables you will not get an error or warning. This is because environment variables may be declared but not used in all configurations that might be run.

If you provide values for undeclared variables defined in a file you will get a warning. This is to help in cases where you have provided a variable value meant for a variable declaration, but perhaps there is a mistake in the value definition. For example, the following configuration:

variable "moose" {
  type = string
}

And the following .tfvars file:

mosse = "Moose"

Will cause Terraform to warn you that there is no variable declared "mosse", which can help you spot this mistake.

If you use .tfvars files across multiple configurations and expect to continue to see this warning, you can use the -compact-warnings option to simplify your output.

If you provide values for undeclared variables on the command line, Terraform will error. To avoid this error, either declare a variable block for the value, or remove the variable value from your Terraform call.

»Variable Definition Precedence
The above mechanisms for setting variables can be used together in any combination. If the same variable is assigned multiple values, Terraform uses the last value it finds, overriding any previous values. Note that the same variable cannot be assigned multiple values within a single source.




Terraform loads variables in the following order
-------------------------
	later sources taking precedence over earlier ones:


	Environment variables
	terraform.tfvars file, if present.
	terraform.tfvars.json file, if present.
	*.auto.tfvars or *.auto.tfvars.json files, 
		processed in lexical order of their filenames.
	-var and -var-file options on the command line, 
		in the order they are provided.

	Step-12: Terraform Input Variables - Review TF Configs for Maps Item
	------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
lab/24-1	
	helps to define a map/dictionary
	e.g. {name = "Vilas", age = 44}.
	
	cp 24 24a
	cd 24a

	(a) Add couple of variables like 

#Public IP SKU
variable "public_ip_sku" {
  description = "Azure Public IP Address SKU"
  type = map(string)
  default = {
    "eastus" = "Basic"
    "eastus2" = "Standard" 
  }
}

#Common Tags
variable "common_tags" {
  description = "Common Tags for Azure Resources"
  type = map(string)
  default = {
    "CLITool" = "Terraform"
    "Tag1" = "Azure"
  } 
}	
	
	(b) Update main.tf - modify mypublicip
	add 
	
	sku = var.public_ip_sku["eastus"]
	tags = var.common_tags
	
	N.B: tags = var.common_tags can be added to any other resources also.
	
	terraform init
	terraform plan
		verify the output

	(c) Add tags to few more resources and execute
	terraform plan
		verify the output

	N.B: 
If the map's key 
	starts with a number (inside a string)  
	e.g. "1-development", 
	use colon syntax : instead of =
	like below
	
variable "my_env_names" {
  type = map(string)
  default = {
    "1-development": "dev-apps"
    "2-staging": "staging-apps"

	------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	https://github.com/stacksimplify/hashicorp-certified-terraform-associate-on-azure/tree/main/28-Input-Variables-Sensitive
	
	confidential variables 
		if used in plain text 
			may be present in 
				env. variables
				command line history
	e.g. 
		export TF_VAR_db_username=admin TF_VAR_db_password=adifferentpassword


	sensitive in Terraform allows us to 
		use as usual.
	Terraform will mask these values 
		in command output and 
		log files
		raise an error 
			if it detects that they will be exposed in other ways.
	Important Note-1: 
		Never check-in secrets.tfvars 
			to git repositories
	Important Note-2: 
		Terraform state file 
			contains values for these sensitive variables terraform.tfstate. 
			You must keep your state file secure to avoid exposing this data.

	(mandatory) requires a data schema to be defined 
		for the Input Variables type 
		Terraform knows what a valid value is.
	use type= object(): 
		A collection of values each with their own type.

e.g.
# Sample object()

Terraform CLi with Workspace
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	https://www.terraform.io/cli/workspaces
	
	In Terraform CLI, workspaces are separate instances of state data that can be used from the same working directory. You can use workspaces to manage multiple non-overlapping groups of resources with the same configuration.

Every initialized working directory has at least one workspace. (If you haven't created other workspaces, it is a workspace named default.)
For a given working directory, only one workspace can be selected at a time.
Most Terraform commands (including provisioning and state manipulation commands) 
	only interact with the currently selected workspace.
Use the terraform workspace select command to change the currently selected workspace.
Use the terraform workspace list, terraform workspace new, and terraform workspace delete commands to manage the available workspaces in the current working directory.
Note: Terraform Cloud and Terraform CLI both have features called "workspaces," but they're slightly different. Terraform Cloud's workspaces behave more like completely separate working directories.

»The Purpose of Workspaces
Since most of the resources you can manage with Terraform don't include a unique name as part of their configuration, it's common to use the same Terraform configuration to provision multiple groups of similar resources.

Terraform relies on state to associate resources with real-world objects, 
	so if you run the same configuration multiple times with completely separate state data, 
	Terraform can manage many non-overlapping groups of resources. 
	In some cases you'll want to change variable values for these different 
		resource collections (like when specifying differences between staging and production 
		deployments), and in other cases you might just want many instances 
		of a particular infrastructure pattern.

The simplest way to maintain multiple instances of a configuration with completely
 separate state data is to use multiple working directories 
 (with different backend configurations per directory, if you aren't using the default local backend).

However, this isn't always the most convenient way to handle separate states. 
	Terraform installs a separate cache of plugins and modules for each working directory, 
	so maintaining multiple directories can waste bandwidth and disk space. 
	You must also update your configuration code from version control separately 
	for each directory, reinitialize each directory separately when changing the 
	configuration, etc.

Workspaces allow you to use the same working  of your configuration and the same plugin and module caches, while still keeping separate states for each collection of resources you manage.

»Interactions with Terraform Cloud Workspaces
Terraform Cloud organizes infrastructure using workspaces, but its workspaces act more like completely separate working directories; each Terraform Cloud workspace has its own Terraform configuration, set of variable values, state data, run history, and settings.

These two kinds of workspaces are different, but related. When using Terraform CLI as a frontend for Terraform Cloud, you can associate the current working directory with one or more remote workspaces. If you associate the directory with multiple workspaces (using workspace tags), you can use the terraform workspace commands to select which remote workspace to use.

Refer to CLI-driven Runs in the Terraform Cloud documentation for more details about using Terraform CLI with Terraform Cloud.

Terraform Provisioner

You can use provisioners to model specific actions on the local machine or on a remote machine in order to prepare servers or other infrastructure objects for service.

Note: We removed the Chef, Habitat, Puppet, and Salt Masterless provisioners in Terraform v0.15.0. Information about these legacy provisioners is still available in the documentation for Terraform v1.1 (and earlier).

»Provisioners are a Last Resort
Hands-on: 
	Try the Provision Infrastructure Deployed with Terraform tutorials to learn about more declarative ways to handle provisioning actions.

Terraform includes the concept of provisioners as a measure of pragmatism, knowing that there are always certain behaviors that cannot be directly represented in Terraform's declarative model.

However, they also add a considerable amount of complexity and uncertainty to Terraform usage. Firstly, Terraform cannot model the actions of provisioners as part of a plan because they can in principle take any action. Secondly, successful use of provisioners requires coordinating many more details than Terraform usage usually requires: direct network access to your servers, issuing Terraform credentials to log in, making sure that all of the necessary external software is installed, etc.

The following sections describe some situations which can be solved with provisioners 
in principle, but where better solutions are also available. 
We do not recommend using provisioners for any of the use-cases 
described in the following sections.

Even if your specific use-case is not described in the following sections, we still recommend attempting to solve it using other techniques first, and use provisioners only if there is no other option.

»Passing data into virtual machines and other compute resources
When deploying virtual machines or other similar compute resources, we often need to pass in data about other related infrastructure that the software on that server will need to do its job.

The various provisioners that interact with remote servers over SSH or WinRM can potentially be used to pass such data by logging in to the server and providing it directly, but most cloud computing platforms provide mechanisms to pass data to instances at the time of their creation such that the data is immediately available on system boot. For example:

Alibaba Cloud: user_data on alicloud_instance or alicloud_launch_template.
Amazon EC2: user_data or user_data_base64 on aws_instance, aws_launch_template, and aws_launch_configuration.
Amazon Lightsail: user_data on aws_lightsail_instance.
Microsoft Azure: custom_data on azurerm_virtual_machine or azurerm_virtual_machine_scale_set.
Google Cloud Platform: metadata on google_compute_instance or google_compute_instance_group.
Oracle Cloud Infrastructure: metadata or extended_metadata on oci_core_instance or oci_core_instance_configuration.
VMware vSphere: Attach a virtual CDROM to vsphere_virtual_machine using the cdrom block, containing a file called user-data.txt.
Many official Linux distribution disk images include software called cloud-init that can automatically process in various ways data passed via the means described above, allowing you to run arbitrary scripts and do basic system configuration immediately during the boot process and without the need to access the machine over SSH.

Hands-on: Try the Provision Infrastructure with Cloud-Init tutorial.

If you are building custom machine images, you can make use of the "user data" or "metadata" passed by the above means in whatever way makes sense to your application, by referring to your vendor's documentation on how to access the data at runtime.

This approach is required if you intend to use any mechanism in your cloud provider for automatically launching and destroying servers in a group, because in that case individual servers will launch unattended while Terraform is not around to provision them.

Even if you're deploying individual servers directly with Terraform, passing data this way will allow faster boot times and simplify deployment by avoiding the need for direct network access from Terraform to the new server and for remote access credentials to be provided.

»Running configuration management software
As a convenience to users who are forced to use generic operating system distribution images, Terraform includes a number of specialized provisioners for launching specific configuration management products.

We strongly recommend not using these, and instead running system configuration steps during a custom image build process. For example, HashiCorp Packer offers a similar complement of configuration management provisioners and can run their installation steps during a separate build process, before creating a system disk image that you can deploy many times.

Hands-on: Try the Provision Infrastructure with Packer tutorial.

If you are using configuration management software that has a centralized server component, you will need to delay the registration step until the final system is booted from your custom image. To achieve that, use one of the mechanisms described above to pass the necessary information into each instance so that it can register itself with the configuration management server immediately on boot, without the need to accept commands from Terraform over SSH or WinRM.

»First-class Terraform provider functionality may be available
It is technically possible to use the local-exec provisioner to run the CLI for your target system in order to create, update, or otherwise interact with remote objects in that system.

If you are trying to use a new feature of the remote system that isn't yet supported in its Terraform provider, that might be the only option. However, if there is provider support for the feature you intend to use, prefer to use that provider functionality rather than a provisioner so that Terraform can be fully aware of the object and properly manage ongoing changes to it.

Even if the functionality you need is not available in a provider today, we suggest to consider local-exec usage a temporary workaround and to also open an issue in the relevant provider's repository to discuss adding first-class provider support. Provider development teams often prioritize features based on interest, so opening an issue is a way to record your interest in the feature.

Provisioners are used to execute scripts on a local or remote machine as part of resource creation or destruction. Provisioners can be used to bootstrap a resource, cleanup before destroy, run configuration management, etc.

»How to use Provisioners
Note: Provisioners should only be used as a last resort. For most common situations there are better alternatives. For more information, see the sections above.

If you are certain that provisioners are the best way to solve your problem after considering the advice in the sections above, you can add a provisioner block inside the resource block of a compute instance.

resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  # ...

  provisioner "local-exec" {
    command = "echo The server's IP address is ${self.private_ip}"
  }
}

The local-exec provisioner requires no other configuration, but most other provisioners must connect to the remote system using SSH or WinRM. You must include a connection block so that Terraform knows how to communicate with the server.

Terraform includes several built-in provisioners. You can also use third-party provisioners as plugins, by placing them in %APPDATA%\terraform.d\plugins, ~/.terraform.d/plugins, or the same directory where the Terraform binary is installed. However, we do not recommend using any provisioners except the built-in file, local-exec, and remote-exec provisioners.

All provisioners support the when and on_failure meta-arguments, which are described below (see Destroy-Time Provisioners and Failure Behavior).

»The self Object
Expressions in provisioner blocks cannot refer to their parent resource by name. Instead, they can use the special self object.

The self object represents the provisioner's parent resource, and has all of that resource's attributes. For example, use self.public_ip to reference an aws_instance's public_ip attribute.

Technical note: Resource references are restricted here because references create dependencies. Referring to a resource by name within its own block would create a dependency cycle.

»Suppressing Provisioner Logs in CLI Output
The configuration for a provisioner block may use sensitive values, such as sensitive variables or sensitive output values. In this case, all log output from the provisioner is automatically suppressed to prevent the sensitive values from being displayed.

»Creation-Time Provisioners
By default, provisioners run when the resource they are defined within is created. Creation-time provisioners are only run during creation, not during updating or any other lifecycle. They are meant as a means to perform bootstrapping of a system.

If a creation-time provisioner fails, the resource is marked as tainted. A tainted resource will be planned for destruction and recreation upon the next terraform apply. Terraform does this because a failed provisioner can leave a resource in a semi-configured state. Because Terraform cannot reason about what the provisioner does, the only way to ensure proper creation of a resource is to recreate it. This is tainting.

You can change this behavior by setting the on_failure attribute, which is covered in detail below.

»Destroy-Time Provisioners
If when = destroy is specified, the provisioner will run when the resource it is defined within is destroyed.

resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  # ...

  provisioner "local-exec" {
    when    = destroy
    command = "echo 'Destroy-time provisioner'"
  }
}

Destroy provisioners are run before the resource is destroyed. If they fail, Terraform will error and rerun the provisioners again on the next terraform apply. Due to this behavior, care should be taken for destroy provisioners to be safe to run multiple times.

Destroy provisioners of this resource will not run if `create_before_destroy`
is set to `true`. We may address this in the future, and this [GitHub issue](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/13549) contains more details.

Destroy-time provisioners can only run if they remain in the configuration at the time a resource is destroyed. If a resource block with a destroy-time provisioner is removed entirely from the configuration, its provisioner configurations are removed along with it and thus the destroy provisioner won't run. To work around this, a multi-step process can be used to safely remove a resource with a destroy-time provisioner:

Update the resource configuration to include count = 0.
Apply the configuration to destroy any existing instances of the resource, including running the destroy provisioner.
Remove the resource block entirely from configuration, along with its provisioner blocks.
Apply again, at which point no further action should be taken since the resources were already destroyed.
This limitation may be addressed in future versions of Terraform. For now, destroy-time provisioners must be used sparingly and with care.

NOTE: A destroy-time provisioner within a resource that is tainted will not run. This includes resources that are marked tainted from a failed creation-time provisioner or tainted manually using terraform taint.

»Multiple Provisioners
Multiple provisioners can be specified within a resource. Multiple provisioners are executed in the order they're defined in the configuration file.

You may also mix and match creation and destruction provisioners. Only the provisioners that are valid for a given operation will be run. Those valid provisioners will be run in the order they're defined in the configuration file.

Example of multiple provisioners:

resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  # ...

  provisioner "local-exec" {
    command = "echo first"
  }

  provisioner "local-exec" {
    command = "echo second"
  }
}

»Failure Behavior
By default, provisioners that fail will also cause the Terraform apply itself to fail. The on_failure setting can be used to change this. The allowed values are:

continue - Ignore the error and continue with creation or destruction.

fail - Raise an error and stop applying (the default behavior). If this is a creation provisioner, taint the resource.

Example:

resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  # ...

  provisioner "local-exec" {
    command    = "echo The server's IP address is ${self.private_ip}"
    on_failure = continue
  }
}

Terraform Module
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Step-01: Understand Terraform Modules and its features
	------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	https://www.terraform.io/language/modules/syntax
	
	A module is a container for multiple resources that are used together.

Every Terraform configuration has at least one module, known as its root module, which consists of the resources defined in the .tf files in the main working directory.

A module can call other modules, which lets you include the child module's resources into the configuration in a concise way. Modules can also be called multiple times, either within the same configuration or in separate configurations, allowing resource configurations to be packaged and re-used.

This page describes how to call one module from another. For more information about creating re-usable child modules, see Module Development.


Calling a Child Module
To call a module means to include the contents of that module into the configuration with specific values for its input variables. Modules are called from within other modules using module blocks:

module "servers" {
  source = "./app-cluster"

  servers = 5
}

A module that includes a module block like this is the calling module of the child module.

The label immediately after the module keyword is a local name, which the calling module can use to refer to this instance of the module.

Within the block body (between { and }) are the arguments for the module. Module calls use the following kinds of arguments:

The source argument is mandatory for all modules.

The version argument is recommended for modules from a registry.

Most other arguments correspond to input variables defined by the module. (The servers argument in the example above is one of these.)

Terraform defines a few other meta-arguments that can be used with all modules, including for_each and depends_on.

»Source
All modules require a source argument, which is a meta-argument defined by Terraform. Its value is either the path to a local directory containing the module's configuration files, or a remote module source that Terraform should download and use. This value must be a literal string with no template sequences; arbitrary expressions are not allowed. For more information on possible values for this argument, see Module Sources.

The same source address can be specified in multiple module blocks to create multiple copies of the resources defined within, possibly with different variable values.

After adding, removing, or modifying module blocks, you must re-run terraform init to allow Terraform the opportunity to adjust the installed modules. By default this command will not upgrade an already-installed module; use the -upgrade option to instead upgrade to the newest available version.

»Version
When using modules installed from a module registry, we recommend explicitly constraining the acceptable version numbers to avoid unexpected or unwanted changes.

Use the version argument in the module block to specify versions:

module "consul" {
  source  = "hashicorp/consul/aws"
  version = "0.0.5"

  servers = 3
}
The version argument accepts a version constraint string. Terraform will use the newest installed version of the module that meets the constraint; if no acceptable versions are installed, it will download the newest version that meets the constraint.

Version constraints are supported only for modules installed from a module registry, such as the public Terraform Registry or Terraform Cloud's private module registry. Other module sources can provide their own versioning mechanisms within the source string itself, or might not support versions at all. In particular, modules sourced from local file paths do not support version; since they're loaded from the same source repository, they always share the same version as their caller.

»Meta-arguments
Along with source and version, Terraform defines a few more optional meta-arguments that have special meaning across all modules, described in more detail in the following pages:

count - Creates multiple instances of a module from a single module block. See the count page for details.

for_each - Creates multiple instances of a module from a single module block. See the for_each page for details.

providers - Passes provider configurations to a child module. See the providers page for details. If not specified, the child module inherits all of the default (un-aliased) provider configurations from the calling module.

depends_on - Creates explicit dependencies between the entire module and the listed targets. See the depends_on page for details.

In addition to the above, the lifecycle argument is not currently used by Terraform but is reserved for planned future features.

»Accessing Module Output Values
The resources defined in a module are encapsulated, so the calling module cannot access their attributes directly. However, the child module can declare output values to selectively export certain values to be accessed by the calling module.

For example, if the ./app-cluster module referenced in the example above exported an output value named instance_ids then the calling module can reference that result using the expression module.servers.instance_ids:

resource "aws_elb" "example" {
  # ...

  instances = module.servers.instance_ids
}

For more information about referring to named values, see Expressions.

»Transferring Resource State Into Modules
Moving resource blocks from one module into several child modules causes Terraform to see the new location as an entirely different resource. As a result, Terraform plans to destroy all resource instances at the old address and create new instances at the new address.

To preserve existing objects, you can use refactoring blocks to record the old and new addresses for each resource instance. This directs Terraform to treat existing objects at the old addresses as if they had originally been created at the corresponding new addresses.

»Replacing resources within a module
You may have an object that needs to be replaced with a new object for a reason that isn't automatically visible to Terraform, such as if a particular virtual machine is running on degraded underlying hardware. In this case, you can use the -replace=... planning option to force Terraform to propose replacing that object.

If the object belongs to a resource within a nested module, specify the full path to that resource including all of the nested module steps leading to it. For example:

$ terraform plan -replace=module.example.aws_instance.example

The above selects a resource "aws_instance" "example" declared inside a module "example" child module declared inside your root module.

Because replacing is a very disruptive action, Terraform only allows selecting individual resource instances. There is no syntax to force replacing all resource instances belonging to a particular module.
